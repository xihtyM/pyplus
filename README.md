# python_scripts
All of my public python projects

To install Python+ simply:

1. Install Python (Preferably latest version)
2. Run commands in powershell:
```pip install os```

```pip install requests```
3. Run the Python+ Installer, specify the directory that you would like it to be installed and the rest should work


> Use .py+ extension to code, compiled programs at this point compile to .ppy+, sooner or later I will make an interpreter but right now I'm still creating the compiler.

> Python+ is still in an incomplete state (Roughly 0.2% complete so far), so it wont run anything as of yet.
