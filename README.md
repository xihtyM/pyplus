# Python+

Installation:

To install Python+ simply:

1. Install Python (Preferably latest version)
2. Run this command in powershell (If you do not have sys library):

```pip install sys```

3. If you do not already have every other imported library, you can install them with the Python+ Fixer included - every library used in the source code will get installed after running.

4. Run the Python+ Installer, specify the directory that you would like it to be installed and the rest should work

Commands:

All working commands in the terminal:

```chdir``` Changes the directory of the compiler.

```py+ compile``` Compiles program, if you are already in the directory then you can enter the name followed by .py+ to compile it. If not, then you can input its path with the name.py+ and it should also work.

```clear``` Clears the console.

Some notes:

> Use .py+ extension to code, compiled programs compile to .ppy+, sooner or later I will make an interpreter but right now I'm still creating the compiler.

> Python+ is still in an incomplete state (Roughly 0.25% complete so far), so it wont run anything as of yet.
